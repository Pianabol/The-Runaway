##  Gameplay

> * ![Gameplay Demo](screenshots/inGame.gif)*

In **Cyber Attack**, you control a rogue virus infiltrating a secure network. Tap the screen to instantly switch gravity (up or down) and avoid oncoming crystal firewalls. The further you travel, the faster the system tries to stop you.

##  Key Features

This project demonstrates advanced iOS game development techniques:

*  **Dynamic Difficulty Engine:** A custom algorithm that increases gravity scale and obstacle speed in real-time as the player progresses, ensuring constant challenge.
*  **SpriteKit Physics:** Utilizes the native physics engine for precise collision detection and custom gravity management.
*  **Procedural Generation:** Implements efficient object pooling logic to generate endless, randomized obstacle patterns without performance drops.
*  **Immersive Audio System:** Integrated `AVFoundation` for seamless looping background music and synchronized sound effects (SFX) for actions like jumping and crashing.
*  **Smooth Scene Management:** Optimized transitions between the Main Menu and Gameplay scenes using `SKScene`.
*  **Performance Optimization:** Using Xcode Asset Catalogs and texture filtering for smooth, high-resolution rendering on Retina displays.
